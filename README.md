# Material Donor Mutual Assist

## Overview
The Material Donor Mutual Assist project by BWorks is designed to streamline the process of managing donations, providing a transparent view into the journey of each donated item. This initiative allows donors to track their contributions from the moment they are donated to their ultimate use, offering them a detailed view of how their items are making a difference. By keeping donors informed about the status and use of their donations, the project fosters a sense of trust and community, encouraging continued support and involvement. The system simplifies the administrative tasks involved in updating and managing donations, making it easier to attract and retain donors who are motivated by seeing the tangible impact of their contributions.

We use Prettier to ensure consistent code formatting across the project. Before pushing your code to the remote repository, follow these steps:

   To automatically format your code, run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run prettier:write

2. **Check Code Formatting**:  
   After formatting, run this command to ensure everything is properly formatted:

    ```bash
    npm run prettier:check
    ```

   Only push the code to the repository once all formatting issues have been resolved.
